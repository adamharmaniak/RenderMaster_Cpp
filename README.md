# RenderMaster_C++
**RenderMaster** is an intuitive Qt application that allows users to render simple **2D** and **3D objects** and manipulate them with ease. Users can **rotate**, **translate**, **scale objects**, and **change their colors** effortlessly.

You can check the *functionalities* of this application described in the **"Functionalities_2D"** and **"Functionalities_3D"** files.

## How to get the application up and running
1. Download the files from the repository.
2. Create a new "build" using CMake (but you need to specify the correct path and version of your Qt in the "CMakeLists" file first).
3. In Visual Studio Community you need to set "ImageViewer" as Startup project.
4. Now you can run the application.
